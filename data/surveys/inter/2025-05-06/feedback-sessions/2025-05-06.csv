"Day 1, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,Continuing with lecture before all blue hats up.
"Day 1, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,Examples (anecdotes) of how the instructors have used this previously can be helpful to me so I better udnerstand how and why these funtions come in handy. And maybe also examples of how when they are not useful?
"Day 1, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,I could use more breaks
"Day 1, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,"I do not get why we would like to open one file at a time eg. 101, then 102. Is it better to import them separately to then combine 101, 102... to do the analysis?"
"Day 1, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,"I have no suggestions, sorry"
