"Day 3, afternoon",could be improved for,"Could there be bits of group-work on a dataset every afternoon, so also on day 1-2?"
"Day 3, afternoon",could be improved for,"I think the dataset was way to expansive and large to work with. There were several features of how the data had been collected how the storage of each individual files. Many challenges that we had to face, which we were not prepared for or was in the reading material. Otherwise we had to do a lot of workarounds (not a bad thing necessarily). Possibly also provide the code for how you would have solved it, something that could be released at the end."
"Day 3, afternoon",could be improved for,It was a bit messy at the start. And also very difficult. But I guess it is hard to find a niveau for all. And also a good idea to get challenged.
"Day 3, afternoon",could be improved for,to have a little look at the data in the end
"Day 3, afternoon",worked well for,Not much
"Day 3, afternoon",worked well for,Very nice to try on our own with a new dataset.
"Day 3, afternoon",worked well for,code along worked well and explained the concept
"Day 3, afternoon",worked well for,to do all three kinds of join
"Day 3, morning part 1",could be improved for,/
"Day 3, morning part 1",could be improved for,A bit more time to the exercise in the end
"Day 3, morning part 1",could be improved for,"Again, the session seemed very long since we waited for all course participants to get finished at the same time."
"Day 3, morning part 1",could be improved for,"Due to the change in schedule, the exercises in chapters 10 and 11 felt rushed through. For the learning experience, you would benefit if you went through the result of the exercises."
"Day 3, morning part 1",could be improved for,"Hard to follow. It's a difficult case, but it probably reflects my lack of skills."
"Day 3, morning part 1",could be improved for,"I learn better when ""being told"" than reading myself. So i like the explaining part of the theory. Reading I can do on my own afterwards - especially with the hands on parts - but I know not all are the same."
"Day 3, morning part 1",could be improved for,I think it worked well:)
"Day 3, morning part 1",could be improved for,It could have been a bit more clear on what parameters you should or can select the column and the associated data.
"Day 3, morning part 1",could be improved for,"Maybe a little longer break, so we could have the cake"
"Day 3, morning part 1",could be improved for,Not enough time for the coding exercise. Don't like that we have to cut code before creating a function. Is there maybe code or ways to keep it for learning reasons?
"Day 3, morning part 1",could be improved for,"Nothing tbh. Coding speed was manageable, the instructor was clear. Good enough time for the exercise."
"Day 3, morning part 1",could be improved for,On the slower side.
"Day 3, morning part 1",could be improved for,To much time for the exercises
"Day 3, morning part 1",could be improved for,a bit slow pace
"Day 3, morning part 1",could be improved for,a lot of waiting time
"Day 3, morning part 1",could be improved for,no suggestion
"Day 3, morning part 1",could be improved for,nothing I can see
"Day 3, morning part 1",could be improved for,nothing. I like it
"Day 3, morning part 1",could be improved for,"seems like a lot of waiting, especially after the reading exercises."
"Day 3, morning part 1",could be improved for,the breaks were too short
"Day 3, morning part 1",could be improved for,was fine
"Day 3, morning part 1",worked well for,Again: the code along and exercise
"Day 3, morning part 1",worked well for,Coding exercise
"Day 3, morning part 1",worked well for,"Easier to follow than yesterday, nice to try the exercise ypurself and check with the ""code used in this section"""
"Day 3, morning part 1",worked well for,Good code-alongs
"Day 3, morning part 1",worked well for,Good introduction and teaching
"Day 3, morning part 1",worked well for,I liked that the pace was a bit higher with shorter breaks
"Day 3, morning part 1",worked well for,I liked the long exercise
"Day 3, morning part 1",worked well for,It was nice working with pivoting. The reading task was nice and the pictures are great for the understanding.
"Day 3, morning part 1",worked well for,Level was very nice for during the morning sessions of day 3
"Day 3, morning part 1",worked well for,Making the function in plenum and then the exercise afterwards.
"Day 3, morning part 1",worked well for,Pivot_*() nice with the larger exercise
"Day 3, morning part 1",worked well for,"Pivoting was challening, however the visuals in the description section of pivot longer and pivot wider, demonstrated the concept nicely."
"Day 3, morning part 1",worked well for,Really nice structure for summarise code
"Day 3, morning part 1",worked well for,The excercises
"Day 3, morning part 1",worked well for,Things are starting to make more sense.
"Day 3, morning part 1",worked well for,This was an interesting and very important session for our work.
"Day 3, morning part 1",worked well for,We could apply methodologies introduced during day 1 and 2
"Day 3, morning part 1",worked well for,code along
"Day 3, morning part 1",worked well for,hands on exercises
"Day 3, morning part 1",worked well for,i think you have some nice ways of showing how the function is useful in this dataset
"Day 3, morning part 1",worked well for,"simple concepts, pretty easy to understand"
"Day 3, morning part 1",worked well for,very useful and great with the illustrations - easy to understand
"Day 3, morning part 2",could be improved for,/
"Day 3, morning part 2",could be improved for,"Could maybe be a better visualization of the actual joining and how that works. Its okay, but you have to sort of decode what the function does and how it reads data frames, can be a bit of a hassle. And this seem to be a problem across all DDEA Reproducible courses. Rename the surveys to that it matches the topics of the what has just been executed. So no ""Day 1 morning"", have the surveys be ordered in terms of ""Pivoting"", ""Pre-processing"" etc. Would make everything much more organized and less confusing."
"Day 3, morning part 2",could be improved for,I actually dont think any thing should chance. Great tempo as well
"Day 3, morning part 2",could be improved for,I think i works great.
"Day 3, morning part 2",could be improved for,I would have liked an exercise that illustrated the difference between left and right join more clearly
"Day 3, morning part 2",could be improved for,"Maybe examples of how this code we are learning works, and what we would need to change if we hadn't learned this code."
"Day 3, morning part 2",could be improved for,Maybe this time could be utilised for another excercise for making functions
"Day 3, morning part 2",could be improved for,None
"Day 3, morning part 2",could be improved for,"Not enough time to finish the exercise, rushed in the end"
"Day 3, morning part 2",could be improved for,Nothing
"Day 3, morning part 2",could be improved for,The final join wasn't in a function - not sure if this was planned. Why not?
"Day 3, morning part 2",could be improved for,examples  in the reading material about left join and right join when using data sets
"Day 3, morning part 2",could be improved for,feel like we spend a lot of time waiting. often you ask for blue hat on really simple things. looks like people just forgot and we are waiting a lot
"Day 3, morning part 2",could be improved for,fine
"Day 3, morning part 2",could be improved for,no suggestion
"Day 3, morning part 2",could be improved for,nothing comes to mind
"Day 3, morning part 2",could be improved for,the analogy (which was not really an analogy but an example) was overly complicated I think - more confusing than helpful
"Day 3, morning part 2",could be improved for,to slow paced
"Day 3, morning part 2",worked well for,Again a new and somewhat difficult subject. A lot of code along here worked fine instead of too many exercises.
"Day 3, morning part 2",worked well for,"Coding exercise was challenging, liked that"
"Day 3, morning part 2",worked well for,"Easy to follow, clear instructions"
"Day 3, morning part 2",worked well for,Everything
"Day 3, morning part 2",worked well for,Fast and efficient
"Day 3, morning part 2",worked well for,I liked the code-along and it was easy to understand
"Day 3, morning part 2",worked well for,I think the joining worked fine.
"Day 3, morning part 2",worked well for,Joining data was very help full. Great explanations and really helpful for future coding.
"Day 3, morning part 2",worked well for,Pretty much everything
"Day 3, morning part 2",worked well for,The schedule was adapted and we still could finish the modules
"Day 3, morning part 2",worked well for,The walk-through of what to do and the example of what would happen with different ways of joining
"Day 3, morning part 2",worked well for,This session went a little faster and that was better
"Day 3, morning part 2",worked well for,everything
"Day 3, morning part 2",worked well for,much smoother run through
"Day 3, morning part 2",worked well for,nice pace
"Day 3, morning part 2",worked well for,nice short section
"Day 3, morning part 2",worked well for,nice teaching
"Day 3, morning part 2",worked well for,playing with the join functions
"Day 3, morning part 2",worked well for,thorough walk through
"Day 3, morning part 2",worked well for,useful tools. the example with party invitation was nice
"Day 3, morning part 2",worked well for,"very nice, nice pace"
End of course,could be improved for the Group Project s,"A solution to look at. The learning curve to get started with the data was a little to steep due to another structure of data. We used all the time to find one feature - which was provided by helpers. So if there were a solution to look at to like ""move on"" when you got stuck, would have been very nice!"
End of course,could be improved for the Group Project s,"Had to leave early, so missed it:("
End of course,could be improved for the Group Project s,I am still a beginner in R. So I could have used more help in the written information in this session.
End of course,could be improved for the Group Project s,I feel that it was missing some guidance and structure - we really didn't go really far in our group
End of course,could be improved for the Group Project s,I think better instruction for how to do the group project and what the specific goals are.
End of course,could be improved for the Group Project s,"I think we should have worked on projects alone. It took to much time setting up the things with github, and we also did that on the introductory course. At this point of the course, i really wanted to practice the coding itself."
End of course,could be improved for the Group Project s,"Maybe add installing and downloading the data in pre-course tasks, so if there are some admin troubles we know from the beginning."
End of course,could be improved for the Group Project s,More time for the group project. Couldn't finish in the end
End of course,could be improved for the Group Project s,More time to work on it
End of course,could be improved for the Group Project s,More time where you collaborate more
End of course,could be improved for the Group Project s,The instructions were a bit unclear. maybe it was due to the tiredness ;)
End of course,could be improved for the Group Project s,We had to leave early
End of course,could be improved for the Group Project s,it was challenging but was really nice to try to make it yourself. perhaps some guidelines and code to use could be nice.
End of course,could be improved for the Group Project s,more time. a lot more time. I felt this part was the most beneficial but we never got to 'clean-up' our code (e.g by using functions) and fell into old (bad) habits due to time restraints
End of course,could be improved for the Group Project s,"to me the group work was much too difficult. it would help if the structure of the folders was more similar to what we had done previously. I also think it took to long to connect to github, and we did noyt make it so far that it made sence to push and pull"
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,Games maybe
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,Maybe a walk outside
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,"Maybe there could be some kind of a quizz at the beginning asking "" how many people modify their excel file before analyzing?, who has had this difficulty? ""  Just for the people who have not used R yet to face their non-reproducible behavior and have an idea of the difficulties that people using R are facing."
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,Nothing
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,"Perhaps some more ""structure"" - especially in day 2 - people sort of disapeared early on, so there were not many to socialize with."
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,The evening programme was a bit too much for my social batteries
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,The spaces provided did not encourage social networking.
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,There is too many of them - while I understand their necessity my social battery was exhausted really fast.
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,Think about social batteries of introverted people.
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,"Walk and talk and a short ""who are you, what are you doing, why are you here""."
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,"maybe some short ""get together activities"""
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,more cake
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,more information
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,they were fine
End of course,worked well for the Group Project,"Compared to the Introductory course it was a bit more messy, but I get that it was a new part of the workshop so lots of troubleshooting was needed."
End of course,worked well for the Group Project,Could use many functions from the past 2 days during the project
End of course,worked well for the Group Project,"Had to leave early, so missed it:("
End of course,worked well for the Group Project,Have time to recall what we have done and think about how to use it
End of course,worked well for the Group Project,I liked that we got another dataset to work on
End of course,worked well for the Group Project,I think the two on two collaboration worked really well and was very casual.
End of course,worked well for the Group Project,It was easy to get help. And the time asigned for is was sufficient.
End of course,worked well for the Group Project,The set up was ok
End of course,worked well for the Group Project,The setup in plenum
End of course,worked well for the Group Project,We could use what we had learned and rewrite functions
End of course,worked well for the Group Project,We had to leave early
End of course,worked well for the Group Project,collaborating with others on the project
End of course,worked well for the Group Project,great to work on our own and have time to encounter realistic problems and errors and try to find a solution on our own while having easy access to help if needed
End of course,worked well for the Group Project,it was easy to get help
End of course,worked well for the Group Project,it was nice to have someone to discuss issues with.
End of course,worked well for the Networking Activities s,All the short breaks between sessions were good and plenty
End of course,worked well for the Networking Activities s,Good to have conversation prompts for the shorter breaks
End of course,worked well for the Networking Activities s,I liked the ping pong:)
End of course,worked well for the Networking Activities s,"I was actually a bit confused about the evening activities. Place, time and what was included. The social activities during the day was ok."
End of course,worked well for the Networking Activities s,I was nice that it topics for discussion were suggested but not mandatory
End of course,worked well for the Networking Activities s,Networking activities were great and structured.
End of course,worked well for the Networking Activities s,Networking session were fun. Would have liked more social activities and not as much discussion.
End of course,worked well for the Networking Activities s,Nicely arranged with evening dinner
End of course,worked well for the Networking Activities s,Others who have more experience with data analysis could share with people less experienced.
End of course,worked well for the Networking Activities s,That we went directly after dinner and that it was put in the program.
End of course,worked well for the Networking Activities s,They are guided
End of course,worked well for the Networking Activities s,Wine was nice
End of course,worked well for the Networking Activities s,nice with topics to discuss about
End of course,worked well for the Networking Activities s,"wine the first evening was nice, and it was nice that we could get it right after dinner."
