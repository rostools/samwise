"Day 2, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,"I did drift a bit, because of the waiting time. Maybe the pace could be faster?"
"Day 2, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,It could have been faster
"Day 2, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,"Maybe a small 'checklist' could be added for remembering all the steps while making functions (eg., delete function from quatro doc, add function in the setup chunk)"
"Day 2, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,Nothing in particular.
"Day 2, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,a bit more information on regex before asking how it is used
"Day 2, afternoon part 1",worked well for,Everything worked really nicely. No major issues.
"Day 2, afternoon part 1",worked well for,It is nice that we get to turn the code into a function multiple times
"Day 2, afternoon part 1",worked well for,It was well explained also in the website
"Day 2, afternoon part 1",worked well for,"More clarity, starting to get the hang of functions"
"Day 2, afternoon part 1",worked well for,Nice with repetition of the things that we learned and then adding twists for every time.
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,"The structure of the earlier sessions was a little different, maybe it was on purpose?"
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,"Okay timeframe, nice to use what was learned earlier"
"Day 2, morning part 1",could be improved for,"1) Could dwell a bit more when explanining what is done when using quirky brackets, here() and so one. ""what is ment with this"", to repeat what's has been learned before, to reinforce it. There is so many new things, and saying the same over an over again in different way helps a lot. 2) in the welcome mail, one could write that it could be an advantage to read the course material beforehand. Actually I wish that this would have been the case"
"Day 2, morning part 1",could be improved for,Everything was great!
"Day 2, morning part 1",could be improved for,Explanation of functional was a bit short (like going over the reading part with the teacher) and I had to read up on the topic online and with the help of ChatGPT
"Day 2, morning part 1",could be improved for,Go trough the code step by step in the end with explicit explanation of what happens at each step.
"Day 2, morning part 1",could be improved for,Heavy reading session. New concept. a bit difficult to understand. Please provide more examples. I fint it helpful when the instructor tells small/quick anecdotes from his/her own work on how they have used these functions.
"Day 2, morning part 1",could be improved for,"I like it, so nothing"
"Day 2, morning part 1",could be improved for,I need a bit of time to fully understand the consept
"Day 2, morning part 1",could be improved for,"I really wish you would explain the individual components of the final code for repetition and understanding. Why is ""folder_path"" written in the function? Why do we first assign to files then data? Whe is the names_to called ""file_path_id""? It would make it vastly easier if you continuously repeat this in a structured way, like you would in language learning."
"Day 2, morning part 1",could be improved for,I think the exercise was difficult
"Day 2, morning part 1",could be improved for,"I think the specific steps in the exercise could be a tad more clear. But it is minimal changes, such as, what to paste, why we do certain steps etc. Just as a reminder or small notes throughout the exercise."
"Day 2, morning part 1",could be improved for,I was a little confused about the exercise in the beginning - i would not mind being roughly told what the exercise is about: just in one sentence and then read
"Day 2, morning part 1",could be improved for,I would definitely like to have more examples or exercises.
"Day 2, morning part 1",could be improved for,I would have like to have 8.3 talked about a bit more - specifically the code examples with some of the short cut rather than just reading about it.
"Day 2, morning part 1",could be improved for,Maybe a little more introduction before doing the exercise. I was a little confused what i should do. It was a little hard to understand the task 8.5.
"Day 2, morning part 1",could be improved for,More explanation of the use of functionals. It was ok writing the code but more emphasis could have been put on the understanding of the thoughts behind.
"Day 2, morning part 1",could be improved for,No suggestions
"Day 2, morning part 1",could be improved for,None
"Day 2, morning part 1",could be improved for,Nothing.
"Day 2, morning part 1",could be improved for,The exercise was a tricky to do on your own
"Day 2, morning part 1",could be improved for,"The exercise went a bit long, even though it was not that challenging."
"Day 2, morning part 1",could be improved for,This was a good session - not much!
"Day 2, morning part 1",could be improved for,Working with another example for making functions
"Day 2, morning part 1",could be improved for,nothing
"Day 2, morning part 1",could be improved for,nothing - i liked it as it is.
"Day 2, morning part 1",could be improved for,"nothing, it was very good"
"Day 2, morning part 1",could be improved for,really nice session
"Day 2, morning part 1",could be improved for,the reading part in the beginning section was a little bit long.
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,"As yesterday very easy to get help. God pace, so I could process the exercise besides just doing it. The presenter is very good."
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,Code along and then exercise. This time was the first where we where a bit more challenged and didnt get a finished 'recipe' for the code during the exercise. There were fortunately plenty of time for the exercise
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,Coding and remembering the learned stuff from yesterday
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,Easy to follow
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,Everything
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,Exercise
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,"Exercise is always key for learning new stuff. I liked, that there was sufficient time to complete the exercise and get help from the table of the many instructors."
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,Felt more challenging in a good way! Very nice to be able to try everything out on our own
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,Good help and explainations
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,I find the map in a function and functions within functions very useful
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,I really liked that there was a longer exercise so we had to think a little more by ourselves.
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,I think it was great that we had more time to make our functionals general.
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,"I think the instructions and guide worked really well. The code was appropriately challenging, with creating a new function with the existing ones. It was a nice assignment."
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,I was late but I was still able to catch up - great idea with writing overall code at website!
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,It was great to discuss with our neighbors what we learned yesterday.
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,Lots of time to test out relatively complex functions.
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,More time working independently with the purrr::map function
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,"Really nice exercise, where we could make the code by ourself. Also nice introduction to the code itself which made it easier to complete the assignment."
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,The degree of difficulty in this sessions: Both concepts explained and exercise was spot on for me. So I really learned soemthing that I may apply in future work
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,The excercise
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,"The review of the exercise in general. It's nice with ""what does what"""
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,Time enough time to make the r script.
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,"Very good practice, and nice to do more exercises. It was nice that we got it told multiple times shat a function and a vector is and how to use map and so on."
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,Very useful information
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,code along and enough time to the exercise
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,good and swift help.
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,most of it :)
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,the analogy and also making it clear that functionals replace loops (also thank god for that!)
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,"the exercise. generally the exercises work well, especially this one when we have to think more by ourselves"
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,time to think and do ourselves some more complex coding than yesterday
"Day 2, morning part 2",could be improved for,/
"Day 2, morning part 2",could be improved for,"A bit too long, maybe it can be split into two different sessions"
"Day 2, morning part 2",could be improved for,Harder to follow. Getting advanced. Nothing to do with the teachers.
"Day 2, morning part 2",could be improved for,I think it was nice :)
"Day 2, morning part 2",could be improved for,"In exercise 9.10, it would have been nice if the things that should be altered in the setup-chunk was part of the steps in the exercise. It is confusing to start with the ""after this exercise your setup-chunk should look like this"""
"Day 2, morning part 2",could be improved for,It sometimes went a little fast
"Day 2, morning part 2",could be improved for,"More ""real world"" examples to better understand how this code is useful and applicable. And maybe also examples on how the code would look like if we didn't learn this new way of coding"
"Day 2, morning part 2",could be improved for,None
"Day 2, morning part 2",could be improved for,Nothing
"Day 2, morning part 2",could be improved for,Sometimes it would be nice to get some perspectives and clinical exampels on what we did in the session.
"Day 2, morning part 2",could be improved for,The discussions could be a bit shorter. I think we had similar discussions during the intro course? So maybe not the most informative/new on an intermediate course
"Day 2, morning part 2",could be improved for,"The exercise session was quite long, a lot of waiting time"
"Day 2, morning part 2",could be improved for,You should recommend people to use {r eval=FALSE} instead of deleting everything in the learning document
"Day 2, morning part 2",could be improved for,a little confused about the curly curly but I dont know if it is possible to explain any better
"Day 2, morning part 2",could be improved for,difficult to understand NSE
"Day 2, morning part 2",could be improved for,"even though we have creating functions before, it is nice if you repeat the step with roxygen, and changes in the r setup"
"Day 2, morning part 2",could be improved for,"more exercise, less code along."
"Day 2, morning part 2",could be improved for,nothing
"Day 2, morning part 2",could be improved for,nothing comes to mind
"Day 2, morning part 2",could be improved for,"the explanation about ""column"" as argument and NSE could be a bit more detailed"
"Day 2, morning part 2",could be improved for,"the task could be nice to start out with 1,2,3 instead of ""what we need to end up with"", so one doesnt get too confused"
"Day 2, morning part 2",could be improved for,works well.
"Day 2, morning part 2",worked well for,Coding ourselves
"Day 2, morning part 2",worked well for,Doing the start of the code together as a code-along. It made it easier to figure out what steps to use. The follow-up where the exercise is showed on screen. I also like the discussion in plenum about possible solutions to sort of comprehend the topic instead of just ONE solution.
"Day 2, morning part 2",worked well for,Everything
"Day 2, morning part 2",worked well for,Great instruction.
"Day 2, morning part 2",worked well for,I fopund it really nice using all these functions. Lot of coding it was nice.
"Day 2, morning part 2",worked well for,I like the code-along and the exercises. Also it was nice with the small discussions were we got to think about how we would join the data and so on.
"Day 2, morning part 2",worked well for,Nice and slow pace. A new and challenging subject to go over. Having the program open in my web browser is so helpful I get lost during the code-along og exercises.
"Day 2, morning part 2",worked well for,"Plenty of time to work on what we learned, good dynamic structure."
"Day 2, morning part 2",worked well for,Quick help and good explaination
"Day 2, morning part 2",worked well for,Same as the other session: building on our knowledge and learning new stuff in a good pace and environment
"Day 2, morning part 2",worked well for,The code alongs and exercises were very instructive to follow and very surprising with the REGEX.
"Day 2, morning part 2",worked well for,"This session was the most advanced in this workshop so far, so it was more challenging then others. I think it was nicely paced and presented."
"Day 2, morning part 2",worked well for,To make functions more times. Now i finally got the point about these functions.
"Day 2, morning part 2",worked well for,Uh it was very difficult. But the pace was good. It was still very easy to get help.
"Day 2, morning part 2",worked well for,"Very difficult to comprehend, but that is ok."
"Day 2, morning part 2",worked well for,Very nicely explained even though NSE is confusing
"Day 2, morning part 2",worked well for,Very well explained. Even though we touched quite complex topics (at least compared to other sessions) it was very easy to follow
"Day 2, morning part 2",worked well for,easy access to help
"Day 2, morning part 2",worked well for,nice pace
"Day 2, morning part 2",worked well for,nice session
"Day 2, morning part 2",worked well for,the exercises
"Day 2, morning part 2",worked well for,very useful and covered a lot
"Day 2, morning part 2",worked well for,worked well
"Day 2, morning part 2",worked well for,works well. good to have lots of repetition on how make functions
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,At this time at the course we dont need to know hos to put in a new chunk and so on. It took a little to long time  form my point of view
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,"For once, a slideshow would be practical with the pivot functions, to show fast and efficiently how the table should look before and after. This could make the subject slightly less abstract."
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,"However, it was a bit too slow sometimes"
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,I could be a little faster
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,"I was a little condusing that we started doing the summarise function before we did the clean_cgm function. It would have been easier to understand if we did the clean_cgm, then the summarise, and then the clean_sleep including summarise"
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,I would like to maybe have learned a little more about if I should make a tibble with more than one column. Like - is it the same approach when you are analyzing data or does it only works for joining?
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,Nothing in particular.
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,The  instructor was a little fast.
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,"The session was a little long and there was a lot of waiting time if you quickly finished the excercises. Maybe the teacher could go further ahead in the material, and then the ones that were not finished could get help."
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,This session was streched a bit too much.
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,"This workshop was especially slow. Even though the blue hat generally works well, it was perhaps a little over-used which resulted in a lot of waiting time for everyone. The repetitions of the reading tasks and the code-alongs were also on the longer side"
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,Very tired in the end :)
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,all nice
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,i think the purpose of the split apply combine method in this case was a little unclear (it just seemed like a way to make a descriptive statistics table like a table 1) but it was actually part of the joining the datasets became clear only after the next session
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,nice function. nothing to improve
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,no suggestion
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,"seemed a little to long. maybe less reading, but keeping the text for notes."
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,was fine
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,"A little hard to follow, but things are starting to come together."
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,Again great instruction
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,Doing the functions together. It speed up the process.
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,Everything worked really well and was easy to follow
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,Good time to work on exercises
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,I liked the exercises.
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,"I really liked adding split-combine-apply into functions, I never thought about using it like that."
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,I think this session was really useful.
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,"It was an easy session, which is nice for the last season in the afternoon."
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,Nice structure for split-apply-combine
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,"Split-appy-combine. Nice ""concept"" to be segmented"
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,The excercises
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,all good
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,"everything, particularly the quick help"
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,good codealong
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,interesting topic
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,mix of teaching methodologies
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,nice exercises
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,nice pace for learning pivot. Really enjoyed the exercise.
