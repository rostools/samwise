2025-05-08,The food and drinks at dinner and after dinner at the venue were a little underwhelming
2025-05-08,It works really well with the sticky/hats and getting quick and good help from nice intructors. I like the website and that you can always go back and read sections again. A really nice course!
2025-05-08,"The accommodation was ok, but very simple. The food was ok, but I missed fruits during the breaks besides the cake."
2025-05-08,I think it was great. More extra material would be nice.
2025-05-08,"When we had to clip the function into functions.R, we lost all the steps in the qmd file, which I learned a lot from. So a suggestion would be  that you encourage people to put a hashtag on the r chunk so that you can keep the codes in the qmd file while also having the functions in functions.file"
2025-05-08,"It made it difficult to review your code from earlier ""step by step"" due to the cut and paste. IT would have been nice to sort of ""repeat"" code more times for each step - so when you have to look at your code later on, you have it step by step."
2025-05-08,It was very nice with the few topics and having the time to work with them. Also it was nice that it was quiet easy and fast to get help. I think it is a very important topic.
2025-05-08,"The code-alongs are very time consuming compared to how much I feel I gain from them. Mostly because of having to wait for minor mistakes/errors to be resolved every few minutes. It can get quite frustrating, so having more on-your-own exercises or maybe even some ""extra"" exercises would be great"
