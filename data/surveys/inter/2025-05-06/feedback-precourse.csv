I would also like to learn to have a more organized workflow. I currently use R markdown so individual scripts that I develop are fairly organized. However, I struggle with keeping track of the changed versions and folder organization. Similarly, in my institute, we do have a system of sharing code. However, it is an issue to decipher each other's code, since there is no 'standardized' way of doing this. I would like to learn better ways to share code."
What do you expect to learn from this workshop and what would you like to be able to do afterward with what you've learned?,"I'm working with data from a human clinical trial. I've performed initial data analysis in Rstudio (mixed model, model check etc) learned from biostatistics courses with little to no reproducibility and/or version control.

"In your opinion, what worked well?",It worked well with hands on.
"In your opinion, what worked well?","It works great with the copy paste manual. And the explanation of what result that are to be expected. Backtracking when new is difficult! It works well to have a website you can open repeatedly. When having to do the introduction course as a pretask course activity for us not able to attend one, the small videos made it easier. When you do not know what to expect, an error often causes the arms to fall of :-)"
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Knowing expectations and what to prepare is always a better starting point for learning in a course. Lots of nice links to open according to need.
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Step-by-step guidance
"In your opinion, what worked well?",The detailed description on what the programmer is actually setting up and the accompanying documentation links. Also the fact the there is a function for checking the setup.

"In your opinion, what worked well?","Yes, absolutely"
"In your opinion, what worked well?",i could get all but one code to run (it was one of the optional once). I think it was well described and it is nice to have all the material online.
"In your opinion, what worked well?",the pre-course material it really well described. Nice that it was adressed for both windows and mac users.
"In your opinion, what worked well?",the step-by-step guide and brush up from the introductory course
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Adding errors that can occur while doing pre-course task and how to fix them, because I guess you have a lot of experience and know with what we are usually struggling. That will allow us to fix the mistake and learn from it."

"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I do not have any suggestions for improvement
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I hope, you use a little time (5-10 minutes to show us/make time before lessons to a quick guide) on the introduction to git hub - reading about it from the introduction course is not enough for me - I would prefer physical attendance to learn it first time as there was no introduction course for me to attend (started as a phd student in March). However, I feel otherwise equipped to learn the objectives for this course."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I think you need to give some tricks and tips to counter the admin issue - I asked ChatGPT to help with that, otherwise I would have been stuck"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I would like it if there was a guide on how to update R and RStudio (if your version is too old), and on how to update your credentials for github (mine was expired since the introductory course and it caused issues - but i managed to fix it)"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I've had a few issues not covered by the pre workshop task where I had to use a chatbot to proceed, eg:> dir_delete(here(""data-raw/dime""))Error: [ENOENT] Failed to search directory '/Users/au483046/Desktop/LearnR3/data-raw/dime': no such file or directory"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Installing everything was a bit challenging at first, especially because I hadn't used Git and RStudio before. It was hard to figure out how to download everything correctly, and I found it difficult to follow the predefined tasks in the exact right order.The first time, I used a Windows work computer and managed to get most things to work. However, when I reached the final step where I had to run r3::check_project_setup_intermediate() in the console, I didn’t get any output.I think the issue was related to an earlier problem, because my project folder was located at ""~/One-Drive.../Desktop/LearnR3"", and since it was a work computer, I couldn’t fix the folder setup properly.Now, I have switched to using my own MacBook, and I find it much easier to complete all the tasks and get everything working as expected."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Is there a cheat sheet that you would recommend? Having so many choices—like those on the Quarto webpage—can be a bit overwhelming."""
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",It might have been nicer to have the 'Create the R project' and 'Quarto' sections before the section on 'Git'.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","It was really clear to me. I encountered some issues with Git credentials, which could be nice to show how to handle."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",It would be nicer to have more solutions in case we had error
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Maybe make a note that, depending where we work, we might be able to download RStudio etc... through the ""company portal"" like it is the case at SDU."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Maybe more pre-work for more experienced R-users
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","More explicitly write what ""a bit like this"" is.. (the last task: the output should look ""a bit like this""). In my output, the ""README.md"" document is missing, as compared to in the pre-workshop notes."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",No. Good as it is
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Nothing
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Nothing at the moment
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Nothing really
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Nothing. I follow the instructions and also used the introduction course material
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Only incremental improvements to consider: Overview/chart flow of the environment and which packages helps set up the environment.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Some of the explanations are difficult to understand and propably makes more sense in the workshop.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",There is a small mistake in the survey. It is asking to run r3::check_project_setup() in the survey but this returns an error. > r3::check_project_setup()Fejl: 'check_project_setup' is not an exported object from 'namespace:r3'It should be written as the code in the pre-task> r3::check_project_setup_intermediate()
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","When having to read more about something on another web page. it would be nice if it opened up in a different ""fane""."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","When you still a a beginner in R, it somestimes can be difficult to understand all the shortcuts. It is very easy to copy paste, and nice when it works. But It is very good the places, where it is described in words what the code mean or how you also can do it. I sometimes experience that when I need to translate/use the codes into other data sets or in an other setting I come in short handed because I miss the link to understand the shortcuts."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",nothing really
Please describe the problems you've had.,"1)One part of the content of the r3::install_packages_intermediate() package didnt install correctly, can recall which one but I was able to proceed nonetheless2)> dir_delete(here(""data-raw/dime""))Error: [ENOENT] Failed to search directory '/Users/au483046/Desktop/LearnR3/data-raw/dime': no such file or directoryBoth the file and folder is present in the project folder and I was able to proceed"
