"In your opinion, what worked well?",Easy and well-structured. The amount of work is fitting.
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Easy to follow the steps
"In your opinion, what worked well?","I like how every step is described thoroughly on the workshop website. And in case we need to read more or would like to recap some topics, there are links to more detailed descriptions."
"In your opinion, what worked well?",I liked that there was a lot of copy-paste to run over the stuff that was covered in the earlier workshops.
"In your opinion, what worked well?","I think it was well structured in general, kudos to that!"
"In your opinion, what worked well?","I was very pleased with the expressive learning goals. I was worried about attending the advanced course prior to the intermediate, but I am convinced i will manage after these introductory tasks."
"In your opinion, what worked well?","In my case, everything worked very well. I think the additional information you provide is very good, so that all participants in this course are on the same level. Of course, the materials provided are often very reading-intensive, but I don't mind that.  I heard from my colleague that there were errors in the code you provided, but perhaps you have already fixed them, because everything works perfectly. I especially liked the section 7 ""Code of conduct""."
"In your opinion, what worked well?",It is great to have the step by step approach that you can follow really thoroughly when needed but can also skip over rather quickly when tasks are familiar or less relevant (e.g. just copy code to download data)
"In your opinion, what worked well?","It is really nice to be ""forced"" to go through the material beforehand just to have an excuse to use your time in learning before the course. I go a little bit frustrated installing and updating software but i understand is part of the process. So very good to make compulsory and to include this survery at the end."
"In your opinion, what worked well?",It is very well explained and it is easy to follow.
"In your opinion, what worked well?","It went very smoothly for me actually, and was able to complete the tasks in under 2 hours :)"
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Most of it - It is very detailed as always which is nice :)
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Most of it worked well for me
"In your opinion, what worked well?","Super nice, the comments are comprehensive and the guide is elaborate and helpful."
"In your opinion, what worked well?",The step by step descriptions so that you can copy /paste and also see what you should get of results. I also like that I feel prepared for the course.
"In your opinion, what worked well?",The website was super well organized and works really well! The communication has also been very clear.
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Very thorough and easy-to-follow tasks.
"In your opinion, what worked well?","all worked well and was easy to follow. Only one library was missing from the downloader+parsing script, but it was easy to spot"
"In your opinion, what worked well?",i think it was nice that most errors had a solution defined directly in the material
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","A small thing, but it's a bit counter intuitive to create a new document as listen in chapter 12 material just to delete the code immediately."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","At the moment, I can't think of anything that could be improved."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Can't think of anything right now
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Double-check library imports
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I can't think of anything. Was clear and nice.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I don't know exactly what happened (should have saved my log!) but something with the order of the tasks did not work for me. I have had github set up previously to I did not need to make a new one, so I skipped step 4 (which was not very clear since there was no link or anything). But since I have been working on Statistics Denmark's servers I have not updated my personal access token. Seemingly that caused problems for step 5 (I think? I kept getting an error even after restarting several times). I initally skipped step 6 because I had set up git for previous courses. But then the check_setup showed me that I had ""bad github credentials"". I did not find a fix on the course page, but eventually ChatGPT helped me fix it. Like I said it was due to an expired personal access token. After fixing the git+github configuration I was able to run step 5 without problems."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I followed the instructions carefully, and still I had to install and load 2 or 3 packages (stringr for e.g.) by myself because they we not mentioned in the instructions and caused errors."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I had a hard time getting r3 to work but switching from RStudio to the RGui as administrator worked. (note; I have a work laptop)
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I had some trouble installing the r3 package and found out that the issue had to do with setting up Git - which was described in the next step. This might be because I don't complety  meet the criteria related to previous R experience.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I have no suggestions
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I personally like to have PDF files so that I can highlight and take notes, so if it would also be possible to receive the R coursework in PDF format, that would be quite nice."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I still had some trouble with running the rostools/r3 and had to ask chat gtp to help me. So I had to install some remote things otherwise the security settings were blocking me.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I think there should be a section on how to update r, rstudio, git etc. Many of us have participated in earlier workshops, and will have most of the programs already."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Perhaps I would suggest installing and loading all the necessary packages already in section 9, since  section 12 requires others that were not previously loaded."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","So far all sections and materials were very clear and easy to follow, so nothing at this point for me!"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",There is a lot of jumping back and front between the overview and pre-workshop
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","This is maybe asking for too much, but for some of the more theoretical section maybe having a video of a real person explaining the things would have been really nice."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","To install the required packages, the correct version of Rtools needs to be installed. E.g., I have recently updated my R to 4.5.0 but had Rtools44 installed from previously. On the website, the 4.4 version is marked as ""(R-release)"", which is the version we are asked to install. However, the 4.5 version is needed when working with R 4.5. A small note regarding matching of R version to Rtools version could be helpful to avoid confusion."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","When having an error with GIT, I don't really know how to fix it. However, I can see that I can get this sorted in the beginning of the course. I think it is a minor thing."

Please describe the problems you've had.,I had trobles in two steps (fixed them both): -I could not install the required pakages (step 2 in section 9) before i updated my git credentials. Consider putting the git-step before this step. -In the nmr-mics script i could not download the datasets. this was fixed with curl::curl_download

Please describe the problems you've had.,"The R3 setup. There is something with Rstudio/and or GIT, but I can't really figure out what went wrong. I have typed it into the questionnaire."
Please describe the problems you've had.,The instructions were not clear to me how to add the Git button to my R Studio IED. I figured it out but had to turn to some external resources.
Please describe the problems you've had.,"Two problems. First problem described in feedback (because I felt the instructions could be more clear). Second problem is just that I am not able to update to latest R version due to organisational restrictions. Instructions say that this is OK, but it does show up as an error on the check_setup"
