2025-09-09,As mentioend I would have prefered a more extensive online pre-course online course I could have taken in my own time with quizzes to test for understanding and a single hour workshop instead to go over the basics. the instructors did well though I just got impatient.
2025-09-09,Is was a nice way to spice up the online version of the workshop with the webpage we used and it was easy to navigate.
2025-09-09,"I really liked the online platform. Its way better and more intuitive than holding the course on, for example, microsoft teams."
2025-09-09,Good job :-)
2025-09-09,I would love to have a workshop on some of the more detailed features in GitHub
2025-09-09,"I think we have to have more discussions about chaning our habits in how to collaborate in github, and have pratical examples (e.g. trach changes and comments in word), and how we should do it different with the powerfullness of github.Gather work very nicely, and keep you a bit more active with th avatars. The sounds quality varies sometimes.Be careful with the recipe examples, I was getting really hugry with the cookie recipe and picture."
