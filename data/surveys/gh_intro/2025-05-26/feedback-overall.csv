2025-05-26,"Måske mere klart hvordan vi kan bruge det til eks word filer. Eller hvordan det ellers kan bruges. Vis hvordan vi tilgår kalendre osv, som er et epi grupperne bruger github til"
2025-05-26,It would be great with a workshop focusing on project managment and how to work with people outside of our organization.
2025-05-26,I am not sure whether I have a feeling of being ready to use GitHub yet...
2025-05-26,"I understood everything today, but I don't think I will start using it in my everyday yet. I feel I need some more knowledge. So for now I stick to what i know (sharepoint and so on). But I would like to use Github at some time."
2025-05-26,"The reading tasks are good. But I was unsure, if it was  necessary to read all the links also."
2025-05-26,In general a bit more hands on/tasks on more possibilities in github and a bit less on the basics and the intro to the workhop itself
2025-05-26,"I want to learn more... Could you consider doing a webinar ? Like a recorded webinar with lots of ""learning by doing""."
2025-05-26,The description of the folder structure and sub-fulders (..) was not clear in the wirtten descriptions but was quite obvious when shown live. Just a real minor issue :) I would sign up for the next in-depth workshop about collaboration and making homepage with Github
2025-05-26,The feedback is based on the course after the introduction
