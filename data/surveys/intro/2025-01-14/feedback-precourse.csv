"In your opinion, what worked well?",Clear instructions on how to prepare for the course :)
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Everything is detailed and user friendly so I found the whole thing really helpful and great
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Everything is very well explained and detailed! It was very easy to navigate through the different tasks.
"In your opinion, what worked well?","Gives a nice overview. Easy to excecute. Nice with videos for those not that familiar with R studio, but also just the option of entering the code if you are a little bit familiar with it. The instructions are easy to follow."
"In your opinion, what worked well?","Great to set up everything before starting, so we don't waste time in the course."
"In your opinion, what worked well?","Having pre-course material works well, as a ""forventningsafstemning"" - expectations-setting"
"In your opinion, what worked well?",How explicitly everything was explained. Nice that you could copy the code directly into rstudio
"In your opinion, what worked well?",I felt taken by the hand and the steps were easy to follow. It worked well that you explained things so detailed and it was good advice to start preparing in good time.
"In your opinion, what worked well?",I found it really informative. Good job.
"In your opinion, what worked well?",I had some troubles getting the code to work on my work laptop due to company restrictions. I am going to use my private computer now (it's much faster anyways).
"In your opinion, what worked well?","I liked the tone of the material, very pedagogical and I feel very guided and like someone is walking me through"
"In your opinion, what worked well?","I think it worked well, I was a bit confused regarding GIT and Homebrew, but I asked a fellow peer who helped me"
"In your opinion, what worked well?",I think the guide is the best guide I have seen in a very long time. Very thorough and easy to understand
"In your opinion, what worked well?","In my opinion, the pre-course provided a solid foundation of background knowledge"
"In your opinion, what worked well?","It is nice to have this pre-course introduction which makes it easier to understand the syllabus, but the Github section is still a hard to understand as a beginner."
"In your opinion, what worked well?",It is very nice that so much of the installing packages can be done by copy-pasting text
"In your opinion, what worked well?",It was very easily understandable and I liked the videos
"In your opinion, what worked well?","It worked well to install R and read about some of the features. I read it a couple of times, since it took a while before my computer could install the programs (since it's under some restrictions from the Region Midt)."
"In your opinion, what worked well?","Nice workfrow, easy to understand"
"In your opinion, what worked well?","Screenshot of R studio, and the copy-button next to the mentioned command"
"In your opinion, what worked well?",The 3.1. with an overview of the tasks that needed to be completed. For most of the subjects there was a great guidance and videos to support it.
"In your opinion, what worked well?",The detailed info on pre-course page is great!
"In your opinion, what worked well?",The guide works really well and the more detailed description of how R reads function like pak::pkg_install is great.
"In your opinion, what worked well?","The preliminary introduction and explanation of Git are more important to me, and the detailed introduction to R and RStudio is also very helpful. I am grateful to DDEA and all the instructors for their efforts in this course, as it is extremely valuable for those who are new to R."
"In your opinion, what worked well?","The setup, with the different topics. It was easy to navigate. It was also easy to understand what I was expected to do, and that it was clearly written ""read this now"", ""do this now""."
"In your opinion, what worked well?","The short, numbered sections made it very easy to approach, and easy to leave and come back to without wasting too much time"
"In your opinion, what worked well?",The small videos from R.
"In your opinion, what worked well?",The steps are very clear and great tutorial.
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Yes
"In your opinion, what worked well?",the precourse material was a good introduction to the course.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","A very simple GitHub repository  to try out, just to see how it looks like. Perhaps it was  strategically left out"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","As a participant with no prior experience with ""homebrew"" or using the ""terminal"" on mac, I found it quit challenging and a bit time-consuming to figure out how to install the git software. Maybe a short guidance on what homebrew is and can do and/or guidance on how the ""terminal"" works would be beneficial for beginners as me."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Everything has been great so far! I don’t have any suggestions for improvement at the moment. Happy to share feedback if anything comes to mind during the course.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Honestly can't think of anything. It was relatively short, relevant and relatable"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I believe the pre-course preparation materials are very detailed. My suggestion is to provide corresponding tasks to help with understanding and memory.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I could have used even more examples of using R codes before the course.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I encountered some trouble configuring Git. The function returned:  I orig[nm] <- git_cfg_get(nm, ""global"") %||% list(NULL) :   number of items to replace is not a multiple of replacement length. With a little help from ChatGPT, I tried to manually configure in Terminal which I think worked out..?Future material could try to amend this and also let the student know, that they might have to work outside a work-VPN. My workplace's VPN seemed to have a firewall that made RStudio unable to find the CRAN-repository. As soon as I got on my private wifi, it worked fine."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I find it very difficult to answer this question before taking the course, as I currently don’t know what else I might need to prepare for."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I still really didn't understand what I did when installing packages in Rstudio, and it didn't always look as it did in the videos, so for me as a beginner, I could have used even more explanation. I would have benefitted from being told that if I have an university-computer, I might not need to download the programs as you suggested, but just install them through my software center. I find the code of conduct a bit aggressive (or very American). I don't know if there have been experiences at the course that makes this necessary, but to me it was a bit much, especially when some things were repeated. Maybe because I see the ""expected behaviour"" as normal appropriate behavior :)"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I was a bit confused about the terminal vs console in the guide explanation under ""3.4 Installing the latest programs"" when r, r-studio and git has to be installed. Also because you have two terminals.(I work on mac) but you have a terminal on your pc and one in r-studio (Which is the same) but then there is also the console. I do not know if others are confused"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I would like to see estimated time to spend on precourse materials.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","It took some time for me to figure out how to install homebrew. Is was not aware it was on my computer terminal the code should be typed. I can se now you have stated this, so I dont now how you can improve this"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Maybe a bit more information regarding the homebrew and git? I was confused, I found the Git in the terminal of the mac with help from a peer. :-D"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Maybe a separate document/page for the pre-course work.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Maybe mention that the red colour is nothing to worry about not only in the Q and A section but also in the pre-course material, as I was a bit worried during the install that something had gone wrong."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Move the notes in section 3.4 to right after the introduction. Section 3.7: give the option of watching the video or cope/paste the code right after each other, to let the reader know that there is two options. Most will probably see the video and thereafter register that there was a second option. For someone with a little bit of R experience, the video feels a bit redundant. Also move the warning field up, so the reader is made aware of this before entering the code."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Not much.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Not sure - it is nicely done already !
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Nothing
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Nothing
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Nothing
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Nothing
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Please provide a guide on how to update R and R-studio. (or a link to a guide)
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Put warnings ahead of the task, got to warnings after I'd had the issue."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",The introduction is really helpful and gives a nice picture of what to expect from the course.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","The layout. When you open the link from the mail, you start on section 3. Would be nice to just start from section 1."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","This is probably an individual issue. Some work computers need administrative access to install R3. So you have to run Rstudio as administrator, however newer versions of Rstudio might not open when run as administrator. I found a workaround by creating a shortcut to the .exe file and then adding ""--no-sandbox"" in the properties section. This allows Rstudio to open and run as administrator and subsequently install R3."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","maybe a FAQ... ""These common mistakes can be solved if you try this and that"""
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",nothing
