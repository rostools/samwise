Day 2,could be improved for the Creating reproducible documents,"A bit too much info considering 1st session was also info-heavy. Also slightly too frequent pauses to try the newly learned code, became a bit boring to wait for the next piece of info."
Day 2,could be improved for the Creating reproducible documents,"Again, maybe more things to do by yourself instead of in the big group?"
Day 2,could be improved for the Creating reproducible documents,All good!
Day 2,could be improved for the Creating reproducible documents,Don't know.
Day 2,could be improved for the Creating reproducible documents,Everything worked well.
Day 2,could be improved for the Creating reproducible documents,"Higher tempo, maybe more focus on how to simplify connections between markdown and R scrips and other programs/data sources."
Day 2,could be improved for the Creating reproducible documents,I believe everything was ok
Day 2,could be improved for the Creating reproducible documents,I don't know
Day 2,could be improved for the Creating reproducible documents,I think all work well
Day 2,could be improved for the Creating reproducible documents,"I think some elements of the Rmd/Quarto files should have been explained more - I helped multiple people who tried to visualize the figure using Ctrl+Enter, and in general the empty line needs of Markdown formatting weren't explained in the detail they perhaps should have been."
Day 2,could be improved for the Creating reproducible documents,I was happy with it :)
Day 2,could be improved for the Creating reproducible documents,I was happy with the session.
Day 2,could be improved for the Creating reproducible documents,I would have like more time  and exercises to practice on my own. However I know a project for us to practice is on its way.
Day 2,could be improved for the Creating reproducible documents,"If possible to spend more time practicing with Quarto, unless we will practice tomorrow"
Day 2,could be improved for the Creating reproducible documents,It is possible to explain even more what we are doing while working? I want to understand. :-)
Day 2,could be improved for the Creating reproducible documents,It is quite a jump to editing in a markdown document from being used to hyperlinks between different document sections in e.g. Word
Day 2,could be improved for the Creating reproducible documents,"It was a bit fast, but a link to the handbook will be useful for later"
Day 2,could be improved for the Creating reproducible documents,It would be nice to get into more details
Day 2,could be improved for the Creating reproducible documents,"Maybe more exercise, and encourage to finish without hints."
Day 2,could be improved for the Creating reproducible documents,"Maybe some more discussion on how to use the markdown files for projects. I understand that it can be very powerful, but it does not provide very nice documents. I would have liked to know how to (if it is possible to use it in combination with for example LaTeX."

Day 2,could be improved for the Creating reproducible documents,"Overall it worked very well for me, I feel like I learned a lot, I don't see for now something specific to improve."
Day 2,could be improved for the Creating reproducible documents,Perhaps go a bit more into linking because this would be important for adding references to the document
Day 2,could be improved for the Creating reproducible documents,"Ran short on timing, would have like a little more time to experiment with altering the writing"
Day 2,could be improved for the Creating reproducible documents,The afternoon session was a bit faster probably todays schedule a bit crowded compared to Day 1 and I feel more tired. So I could not catch 100% things but probably it is on me.
Day 2,could be improved for the Creating reproducible documents,The benefits over other popular document writing software may be discussed.
Day 2,could be improved for the Creating reproducible documents,We ran a bit out of time but overall it was really great since we covered the basis.
Day 2,could be improved for the Creating reproducible documents,is there perhaps a way to make a chart from the dataset and include it in Quarto document as an image? i think that would be useful

Day 2,could be improved for the Data management and wrangling,I don't know
Day 2,could be improved for the Data management and wrangling,"I find it hard working on laptop only, it is really bad for vision and physical work position and overview of tasks/windows/programs. Personally i would prefer using bigger screens and keyboards (Computer rooms if that even exists now??)."
Day 2,could be improved for the Data management and wrangling,"I found it a bit hard to understand what I was while coding together. If I started to think things through, I couldn´t keep up with the tempo. So I decided to just ""do"" as I was told. I am a complete beginner when it comes to R though."
Day 2,could be improved for the Data management and wrangling,"I think it was a bit slow but good, maybe a bit more excersise"
Day 2,could be improved for the Data management and wrangling,I think it was good overall
Day 2,could be improved for the Data management and wrangling,"I was a little confused when we filtered columns and renamed them, and then we didn't see the changes because they were not saved as a new factor/dataset. Maybe I missed it but it could be nice to have this indicated somewhere."
Day 2,could be improved for the Data management and wrangling,I was happy with it :)
Day 2,could be improved for the Data management and wrangling,I was very happy with how it was honestly
Day 2,could be improved for the Data management and wrangling,I would have liked to learn more wrangling functions. Probably common mistakes when using this functions can be also interesting to watch.

Day 2,could be improved for the Data management and wrangling,It was pretty straight-forward and I have no further suggestions.
Day 2,could be improved for the Data management and wrangling,Maybe devoting more time to practice on Quarto
Day 2,could be improved for the Data management and wrangling,Maybe even more exercises to do by yourself?
Day 2,could be improved for the Data management and wrangling,"Maybe several levels of actually typing code? In the exercises today very much of the code was already written (just filling in missing parts). That's very good to begin with, but maybe I would have learnt even more from a level 2 exercise where I would have needed to provide more code myself. (I do realize time is a limiting factor.)"
Day 2,could be improved for the Data management and wrangling,Nothing
Day 2,could be improved for the Data management and wrangling,Nothing.
Day 2,could be improved for the Data management and wrangling,"Overall it worked very well for me, I feel like I learned a lot, I don't see for now something specific to improve."
Day 2,could be improved for the Data management and wrangling,"Please go a little bit slow as we need to listen to you, look on the board and type the same in our computer. A 10 second pause would be helpful in between."
Day 2,could be improved for the Data management and wrangling,Some easy code can be read by students themself
Day 2,could be improved for the Data management and wrangling,"There were places where the teachers deviated from the code in the R-cubed site we have access to, which led to momentary confusion - not a big deal, though!"
Day 2,could be improved for the Data management and wrangling,"This is not specifically for this session, but it might have been good to stress that all commands have a help documentation in R if you want to read up on it more."
Day 2,could be improved for the Data management and wrangling,Time for some of the excercises and reading tasks was a bit tight at times but everything was still doable.
Day 2,could be improved for the Data management and wrangling,We could have seen a bit more how to make operations on data to prepare data for figures for instance.
Day 2,could be improved for the Data management and wrangling,good
Day 2,could be improved for the Data management and wrangling,"i need to confess that i didnt update my R during pre-course task because it was written that 4.1.2 was enough in the pre-course tasks (sorry!). but apparently NHANES needs more updated R version, so i had to uninstall the old R and reinstall the updated R (and the R packages) during the course. so perhaps the pre-course tasks should require the most updated version of R."
Day 2,could be improved for the Data management and wrangling,use a smaller dataset
Day 2,could be improved for the Data management and wrangling,"we could maybe have a different type of data which is harder to understand. For example, not a metadata table but a table with counts of genes which can be more difficult to understand."
