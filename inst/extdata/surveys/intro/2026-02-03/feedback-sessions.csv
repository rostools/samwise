Analytically reproducible documents,2026-02-03,worked well for,"All of the code-along worked very well, and again with the hats as well to make sure that everyone's on the same page. Also the hat makes me feel like I'm giving myself a small pad on the back for keeping up haha - very encouraging. I also SO appreciate how well-organized and well-written the website is, so that I don't have to split my focus between keeping up with the session while taking notes, because the website has everything already."

"Split, apply, and combine",2026-02-05,could be improved for,"I do not really have anything. Maybe in general (just in case I would forget to mention it in the overall feedback survey, it could be beneficial to make extra exersices for those that finish quicklier, because they then did not spend as much time waiting for those, that are less experienced/has technical issues."

Team project work,2026-02-05,could be improved for,I wouldn't change anything. It was really a very helpful session.
Team project work,2026-02-05,could be improved for,"Maybe a bit more defined tasks, as in ""do 1 table, do 1 plot, do 3 graphs""-ish. The group-making and downloading of data didn't necessarily had to be performed in front of the whole class. If that was done during breaks, we would have more time to work on our own project.One could consider dividing the class between the helpers, to ensure, that if a group encounters a problem that arises multiple times during same tasks, the helper already know what the issue was previuously."
Team project work,2026-02-05,could be improved for,"Maybe too much time for it, but it is always better to have more time than too little."

Team project work,2026-02-05,could be improved for,nothing
Team project work,2026-02-05,could be improved for,"some of the figures given does not make sense. Can be confusing and feel like I'm doing something wrong. Maybe make it clear the plots may not make sense in an biological sense. + The ""group"" work did not feel much like group work"

Also getting to use the help/? function in R to understand and play around with the different functions and arguments was great. It was nice to have a partner to collaborate with as well. I really think the task was rather straight-forward to complete, because everything in the curriculum has been communicated super clearly by all of the instructors and the material. Great experience!!!"

Team project work,2026-02-05,worked well for,Independent work with dataset was very nice!!
Team project work,2026-02-05,worked well for,"It was an amazing session to actually test myabilites with R, and to really put into practice how to start from scratch. Honestly, this session was a summary of all my comments in the what could be improved question that Ive previously had during the previous sessions, so its an amazing way of wrapping up this course. Also, the ratio of participants and helpers makes it easy to actually get your issues resolved in a very fast way."

Team project work,2026-02-05,worked well for,really good working in a group setting
Version control with Git,2026-02-03,could be improved for,"- I missed some more visual introduction to Git (maybe as the very first thing or after each section), such as a few very simple slides or similar rather than just reading the text. Could also be some kind of ""this is how I usually use it step by step - first before trying ourselves and maybe even before reading the sections. Since I could have used a more thorough introduction to git... - I missed some more information/going through the sections after having read it."
Version control with Git,2026-02-03,could be improved for,...
Version control with Git,2026-02-03,could be improved for,"A little more explanation about Git, perhaps showing some examples on when and how you would use it in real-life, as well as looking back at your earlier versions. Also a little better flow in the session. There was a lot of 'silent time'."

Version control with Git,2026-02-03,could be improved for,I would have liked to see git from the start to know what we would be working towards
Version control with Git,2026-02-03,could be improved for,"If the things we read about were explained, instead of we just move on"
Version control with Git,2026-02-03,could be improved for,It was a bit hard to hear what the instructor was saying

Wrangling with visualizing,2026-02-05,could be improved for,A little too little time for finish the task. Might be an idea to go through the tasks after finishing it to clarify that everyone understood what was done step by step.
Wrangling with visualizing,2026-02-05,could be improved for,Could have used more time to do the exercises
Wrangling with visualizing,2026-02-05,could be improved for,Hard to pin point what could be improved - keep it up :)

Wrangling with visualizing,2026-02-05,could be improved for,"There was a great focus on inclusion etc before and at the beginning of this course.Despite this, we have spent a geat deal of time this morning dividing people into normal people and FAT people, who we all know are going to die early, after costing our societies a disproportionate amount resources and disrupting societal esthetics while doing so.Normally I am okay with being fat, the associated social stigma, working with BMI data etc, but honestly it got to me that there was this great focus on being inclusive, only for the teachers collectively proceeding to be very explicitely non-inclusive.Being the only obese person in the room  combined with the weird interpretation of inclusivity honestly made it hard to focus on the work."

Wrangling with visualizing,2026-02-05,could be improved for,"more clear description of the exercise.... the one with the color of the second plot is a bit unclear if it should be in the aes(x=,y=, colour) or the facet_grid().... maybe in both?"
Wrangling with visualizing,2026-02-05,could be improved for,nothing
