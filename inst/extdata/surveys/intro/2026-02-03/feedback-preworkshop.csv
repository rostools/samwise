"In your opinion, what worked well?",section 7 and 8
"In your opinion, what worked well?",i think it was nice to have a step by step guild with very clear instructions
"In your opinion, what worked well?",The overview was nice and good to make sure all the basic installations are in place
"In your opinion, what worked well?","Guiden fungerer rigtig godt for begyndere. Den er let at læse, har overskuelige og logiske steps, og forklarer tydeligt både hvad man skal gøre og hvorfor. Layoutet gør det nemt at følge med, og de små illustrationer/eksempler hjælper med at forstå, hvordan installationen foregår. Guiden bygger også en god baggrundsforståelse."
"In your opinion, what worked well?","The material is very beginner-friendly, guiding you step by step and explaining the rationale behind each step. It is very useful."
"In your opinion, what worked well?",The online site and navigating in this!
"In your opinion, what worked well?",All the functions worked perfectly and was easy to follow
"In your opinion, what worked well?",It was very easy to understand and had nice illustrations.
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Well described what was expected and i like that thing will be repeated and you have the material available both during and after the course.
"In your opinion, what worked well?",A great combination of both reading and hands-on tasks. The guides on how to install software and packages were easy to follow.
"In your opinion, what worked well?",The guide for installing all the programs and packages
"In your opinion, what worked well?","I liked the small info boxes, explaing that and error here is not unusual"
"In your opinion, what worked well?",The descprition if when to use Git an what it can be used for.
"In your opinion, what worked well?","Really nice, with the thoroughly explainations"
"In your opinion, what worked well?","It was clear what was to be done beforehandThe reading material was informative, and the content was presented in a very pedagogical way, which was helpful when having very limited prior knowledge of the subject.It is a good thing that you warn us to start the preparation process early due to potential IT problems."
"In your opinion, what worked well?",It was very well organized and I was not at any point in doubt on what I should read or do.
"In your opinion, what worked well?","In my opinion, what worked well was that the content was very well explained and easy to follow. The structure was clear, and complex concepts were presented in a way that made them accessible and easy to understand, even when dealing with technical material."
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Some of the installation went really well
"In your opinion, what worked well?",The reading tasks were doable and understandable.
"In your opinion, what worked well?","The material was thorough and comprehensive, and I appreciated the depth of content provided, tanking into account that I am at a beginners level."
"In your opinion, what worked well?","The summary of tasks in 5.1 was very helpful, as well as the very pedagogical explanations on how to complete the tasks."
"In your opinion, what worked well?","Worked well to download the packages while continuing to read and optimize the time. Also, the cheatsheets are very nice"
"In your opinion, what worked well?",I simply haven´t had time to go through the material. Will do so during the weekend :)
"In your opinion, what worked well?","I had an R studio that ran basic stuff, but did not like pre-workshop setup protocol(unable to access index for repository https://cran.rstudio.com/src/contrib).I updated to newest R and RStudio, as my extant versions were slightly too old.Don't know if the phrase ""at least .."" in the R/RS version should have had an upper bound as well?As far I can see tidyverse still works, so I guess I am okay for the course? If not, please advice."
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Good overview and structure with step by step introduction to how to install all relevant programs.
"In your opinion, what worked well?","I really found the overview and the availability of the materials to be great, and the language used to be well written. Thank you for also showing photos, and indicating code to be used, clearly."
"In your opinion, what worked well?","It worked really well with the material. It would be nice, if it was even more explicit, that we had to attend a ""pre-workshop"" and to get the information, that we got a slot even earlier especially because it takes at least half a days work to get through. I could not make the r3 installation work, but since i'm not that familiar with R, I honestly do not no how you could possible improve that."
"In your opinion, what worked well?",yes
"In your opinion, what worked well?",I liked the flow and the easy to copy boxes
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",prereading section was very extensive
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",maybe a small section where it says that u can do this even if u have a github account setup_git_config(). i got a little confused and was afraid i had to create one more
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I dont know
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I had trouble doing the steps for 9  Installing R packages (pak::pak(""rostools/r3"", upgrade = TRUE) and below). The problem was not R or RStudio, but a Windows group policy that blocked external executables used by the pak package. This caused repeated installation failures.The solution that worked was to avoid pak entirely and install all required packages manually using base R (install.packages()) and remotes::install_github(). By replacing r3::install_packages_introduction() with a manual, curated package list, everything installed and loaded correctly.I tried it on my private computer as well. Here the problem ws ""could not find tools necessary to compile a package call 'pkgbuild::check_build_tools(debut = TRUE)'"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","In the Github-tab I had to get some help from ChatGPT before I could use the r3-command. I had to do this:install.packages(""remotes"")pak::pak(""rostools/r3"")r3::setup_git_config()r3::check_setup()Maybe I misunderstood something, but it works now anyways :-)"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",A bit difficult to install Git and Homebrew.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Too many repetitions
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",The first email could include how much time is expected to finish the tasks before the course. There was a text referring to a video (in 9 in between install pak and pak::pak) which I could not find.It seems like completing 9 requires administrator rights on your computer. Maybe this should be mentioned in 7 (as administrator rights has a time limit on hospital owned computers).
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I could not use this ""pak::pak(""rostools/r3"", upgrade = TRUE)"" in R because the xml2 1.5.2 failed to be build - with the help from AI i got it to work by installing xml2 1.5.2 package separately. However, it might be good to be aware of."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Nothing
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","For R-tools, it could maybe specify that the version of Rtools and installed version of Rstudio must match"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Maybe a bit clearer instructions on how to install the different things
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","You could specify where to find the ""Tools"" and the ""Global Options"". Found in the menu line."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Maybe if there were vidoes.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I had some trouble with R-codes because of work place group policy restrictions. Unfortunately the IT department was not much help. In the end, chatGPT helped us with a solution to get the packages installed via the package 'remotes'. Hopefully everything is set up all right now. But it ended up taking quite a lot of time. I know this is obviously nothing you can control, but perhaps you can look into the package 'remotes', and recommend it for future attendees that have similiar issues?"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I think you should keep it as it is.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","At this stage, there is nothing specific that I would suggest improving. The content has been clear and well structured. I am now looking forward to the hands-on, real-time practical sessions."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",But some were a lot more complicated than was to expect from the description
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","The installation of R, R Studio, and Git I found difficult. I think my lack of knowledge about the programmes complicated the proces a great deal. And when I did not get the expected answer from e.g. R Studio or HomeBrew when installing Git I found it almost imposible to move on and solve the issues. I feel like I have not succeded in completing the instructions in R because I initially got one code I did not understand and then afterwards continuosly get the code ""Error in loadNamespace(x) : there is no package called ‘r3’"". Therefore I am now nervous to come the first day having failed the pre-course tasks."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Perhaps the flow could be improved, as I often had to navigate between multiple chapters to follow along. Especially in Chapter 6, which required referencing Chapters 1, 2, 4, 16, and 23. I ended up with multiple tabs open."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Nothing to put my finger on...
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I was a bit confused about the ""6 Pre-reading"" which only gives some of the chapters but when you start in ""5 Overview"" it doesn't give the same chapters"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I simply haven´t had time to go through the material. Will do so during the weekend :)
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I probably did something stupid., but a test of upper bound for R/RS versions if it turns out I did not."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I think it will be more easy to answer retrospectively.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I did experience one error as I was setup up Git: ""r3::setup_git_config()Advarselsbeskeder:1: I orig[nm] <- git_cfg_get(nm, ""global"") %||% list(NULL) :  number of items to replace is not a multiple of replacement length2: I orig[nm] <- git_cfg_get(nm, ""global"") %||% list(NULL) :  number of items to replace is not a multiple of replacement length3: I orig[nm] <- git_cfg_get(nm, ""global"") %||% list(NULL) :  number of items to replace is not a multiple of replacement length> r3::check_setup()Checking R version:Error in `get_allowed_r_versions()`:!

"" Here I simply used the suggestion from R. : `install.packages('rversions')` And it worked. My setup in R studio, as the material warned it might not, did not show three different windows (A, B, C, D), perhaps a few photo's of how it could otherwise look, could help the learner to feel confident in whether their installation process worked.However, the material has been great so far!"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Please see the above
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",nope:)
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Let's see after the course :-P

Please describe the problems you've had.,I had problems from assignment 9.2 and has previously submitted the survey without having resolved the problem. This has been solved now
Please describe the problems you've had.,"When trying to follow the instructions in R I first got one code that did not looked like the expected (I did not take a screen shot of the code). I then waited a day, and afterwards I can only get the code ""Error in loadNamespace(x) : there is no package called ‘r3’"". This means that I have not completed the instructions in R. Another problem is, that when making a GitHub user the programme made a profile without me being able to create a code, therefore I now don't know if I have a code or not.
