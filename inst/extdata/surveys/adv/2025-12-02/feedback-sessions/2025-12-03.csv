Design your analysis: Build up one model first,could be improved for,I understand why the flow is made as is but I (and probably others) want to jump the gun and adapt the function to work on all metabolites. So it feels like a bit of a slow progress when we know it has to be changed. I don't really know how to do it better though...
Design your analysis: Build up one model first,could be improved for,I would have appreciated more time for understanding this better
Design your analysis: Build up one model first,could be improved for,"It seemed difficult for some students to follow the conceptual idea. Maybe this is better explained by first doing and later explaining instead of trying to conceptualize first? But of course, that's not a natural way of doing it in real life."
Design your analysis: Build up one model first,could be improved for,It seems like some students are hijacking the classroom by asking question about things that are part of later sections of the exercise. It would be nice if the instructors keep on the subject at hand.
Design your analysis: Build up one model first,could be improved for,"It would have been nice if the teacher would have cut through at some point, when the class discussion got a little out of topic and scope."
Design your analysis: Build up one model first,could be improved for,Just a little more time for the exercises!:)
Design your analysis: Build up one model first,could be improved for,Maybe it was covered in intermediate/beginner but maybe briefly stating what estimate and intercept means for the data. State shortly which conclusions can be inferred.
Design your analysis: Build up one model first,could be improved for,My brain was kinda in late of the day mode
Design your analysis: Build up one model first,could be improved for,"The beginning was a bit slow, perhaps with too much discussion in the first question"
Design your analysis: Build up one model first,could be improved for,There could be extra exercise to run for those who have time :)
Design your analysis: Build up one model first,could be improved for,"This also accounts for earlier, but i just throught about it now: It is somewhat confusing that the columns in the dataset are called ""value"" and ""class"". E.g., ""what is the value of value?"" I think they should have less generic names to avoid confusion."
Design your analysis: Build up one model first,could be improved for,"This session went too fast. Additionally, it would be super helpful if more comments in the code were there. Overall, we were missing a bit of the map of the greater process, and it felt like we were doing steps without knowing what they were for in the bigger picture.  Starting by stating the steps as a whole to understand the workflow first would be SUPER helpful."
Design your analysis: Build up one model first,could be improved for,Using only Cholesterol in the create_model_results() doesn't make sense for me
Design your analysis: Build up one model first,could be improved for,When stuff happens in the palette it can be difficult to follow along if you are not up to date - perhaps verbally say the steps with the names of the functions can help. When things are in the console it is easier to keep up
Design your analysis: Build up one model first,could be improved for,"While I enjoyed the exercises very much, I have to admit that I had trouble following Birgittes teaching style. I never doubted her ability or expertise, but there were some very long pauses where my mind started to wander."
Design your analysis: Build up one model first,could be improved for,"Would be nice to say a bit more out loud what is done, so that if we are coding/looking at our computer we are not lost because not looking at teacher's screen :)"
Design your analysis: Build up one model first,could be improved for,maybe some reading tasks
Design your analysis: Build up one model first,could be improved for,"the idea of designing the analysis/pipeline backwards (start at the end) is great, but I feel that in this section im not completely sure what were are building - so we are actually not working backwards but forward. For example I would normally have the function take two arguments data and metabolite so that I can run it for all metabolites - but clearly that is not what we are doing here, so I am curious what we are doing instead - but rather than be curious I would like to know where we are going from the beginning"
Design your analysis: Build up one model first,worked well for,A good combination of code alongs and exercises.
Design your analysis: Build up one model first,worked well for,Better Idea on how to build this pipeline

Design your analysis: Build up one model first,worked well for,The conceptual idea and adding functions in the _target.R file was great.
Design your analysis: Build up one model first,worked well for,The design of the exercises moving from testing the code to wrapping it in individual functions that have a distinct purpose
Design your analysis: Build up one model first,worked well for,The exercises were good
Design your analysis: Build up one model first,worked well for,The visuals in the textbook were super helpful

Design your analysis: Build up one model first,worked well for,code-along and repetition of the workflow
Design your analysis: Build up one model first,worked well for,great to make it clear that you can join different functions into one to make a clean pipeline rather than have each function be a target
Design your analysis: Build up one model first,worked well for,practical session
Design your analysis: Build up one model first,worked well for,well explained
Using the pipeline to build up research output,could be improved for,"- Starting with more of a zoomed out perspective of what a Tar final product looks like, I felt like we learned the ""how"", before the what and why- Remind people to use the orange hats instead of asking lots of questions to the wider group =)- How to handle non-function related pipeline additions (like a small 1-off spelling error in df)"
Using the pipeline to build up research output,could be improved for,:)
Using the pipeline to build up research output,could be improved for,A bit slow and would be nice if you explain how to used targets in your own projects. Maybe show your own tar_visnetwork so we can see the possibilities.
Using the pipeline to build up research output,could be improved for,"A more concise understanding of when which packages/functions should be specified. E.g. tidyverse the inner packages of  tidyverse (dplyr, ggplot2 etc.)"

Using the pipeline to build up research output,could be improved for,"I would really like to have an example of how to make it more generic with specifying e.g. function(data, colum for group_by, colum for stats) - that is what I am going to use and tried myself."
Using the pipeline to build up research output,could be improved for,I'm maybe still a bit too rookie to understand the meaning of targets in your daily workflow
Using the pipeline to build up research output,could be improved for,"Some fellow students lost track of the goal during the code-alongs. However, this was nicely included in the online material. Maybe just a matter of instructor emphasising this more."

What are statistical models?,could be improved for,I personally prefer the more code-along and exercises the better
What are statistical models?,could be improved for,I think it could be either shorter in time or if the same amount of time is kept then more things on stat could be added :)
What are statistical models?,could be improved for,I think it worked well.
What are statistical models?,could be improved for,I understand the need to simplify the statistical content for the course but perhaps additional details or reading recommendations could be recommended in this section to avoid oversimplification
What are statistical models?,could be improved for,"Maybe give some extra resources on packages for running different types of models? But overall, I think stats is clearly not the focus of this course so I think it's good that not that much time was spent on this, but just enough to know how to apply design thinking to running models."
What are statistical models?,could be improved for,Ok!
What are statistical models?,could be improved for,The first part of the session was too theoretical
What are statistical models?,could be improved for,"There was quite a lot of reading and listening, and not so many exercises"
