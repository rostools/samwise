Dependency management for smoother collaboration,could be improved for,Clearer introduction to README.md in the different folders
Dependency management for smoother collaboration,could be improved for,I don't have suggestions right now.
Dependency management for smoother collaboration,could be improved for,I think this whole session (including intro) is taking a very large amount of time and could be faster maybe :)
Dependency management for smoother collaboration,could be improved for,I was out of time for the last part of the session.
Dependency management for smoother collaboration,could be improved for,I was satisfied overall. For now everything is optimal.
Dependency management for smoother collaboration,could be improved for,"In order to turn back to these notes in the future, it would be nice to have a simplified block of code call with very brief description  of the code to replicate in future projects. Also, I would love the course website in PDF format."
Dependency management for smoother collaboration,could be improved for,"It felt like a bit much to have to read through the 15.1 reading exercise again, when we also read it before the course"
Dependency management for smoother collaboration,could be improved for,Kind-of repetitive with pre-workshop tasks
Dependency management for smoother collaboration,could be improved for,"Mabye add to the info mail, that you should definitely bring you own headphones, so that you can lisen to the read through selections IF you are dyslexic : )"
Dependency management for smoother collaboration,could be improved for,Nothing
Dependency management for smoother collaboration,could be improved for,Nothing :)

Dependency management for smoother collaboration,could be improved for,"The editting of the readme files was slightly confusing. It would make sense to do for a projekt where I had an overview and knew the files. However, the conceptual idea is clear and well communicated. But the actual task was slightly arbitrary and didn't need to take long."
Dependency management for smoother collaboration,could be improved for,To much repetition from last course
Dependency management for smoother collaboration,could be improved for,a little more information about what the things we do in r means/does in the code along parts.

Dependency management for smoother collaboration,worked well for,Love the hatsGood with the read through.
Dependency management for smoother collaboration,worked well for,"Slow and efficient coding. Very easy to follow, good as a nice startup session."
Dependency management for smoother collaboration,worked well for,The code along and explanaitions of what happens and why
Dependency management for smoother collaboration,worked well for,"The combination of different learning styles, so there were small talks/lectures, reading, code-alongs and exercises.

Dependency management for smoother collaboration,worked well for,"The content was on point, and the mix of reading, then speaking, then doing worked really well"
Dependency management for smoother collaboration,worked well for,"The exercises and having the material online, so I could read through if there was something I didn't catch."

Dependency management for smoother collaboration,worked well for,nice with easy access to help and exercises
Setting up automatic data analysis pipelines,could be improved for,"- having a code cheat sheet for all of the commands used that are not in the ""textbook"", especially those only referred to in the console- giving some more concrete examples of what a simple but complete pipeline will look like to we can picture the zoomed out version a bit more before diving into the minutia"
Setting up automatic data analysis pipelines,could be improved for,"A bit (too) much talk, a little (too) little code-along"
Setting up automatic data analysis pipelines,could be improved for,"For me it was a bit slow, and I wished for a more details why exactly targets its best to use and also cover things like efficiently, storage use etc."
Setting up automatic data analysis pipelines,could be improved for,Hard to relate to how we will use it practically
Setting up automatic data analysis pipelines,could be improved for,"I don't think it is up for improvement but I had to restart the R session a few time to make target work. Maybe you can put it as an advice if some people panic because it is not working right away : ""Restart your R session if doesn't work"""
Setting up automatic data analysis pipelines,could be improved for,"I think it is a bit hard to understand when exactly target is smart, since it seems like a lot of work to build functions for everything"
Setting up automatic data analysis pipelines,could be improved for,I think this session had a lot of questions that were hard to follow. I could have used more time on how applying the targets fit into the big picture ambitions presented prior to lunch.
Setting up automatic data analysis pipelines,could be improved for,It is difficult to figure out how to use this framework for larger and more complex projects. I hope that it will become clear over the next sessions!

Setting up automatic data analysis pipelines,could be improved for,Nothing to note.
Setting up automatic data analysis pipelines,could be improved for,Perhaps include some more complex examples for those who are interested
Setting up automatic data analysis pipelines,could be improved for,"Usage of targets is not very intuitive to me, I had a bit of trouble making myself a clear idea of how it works/how to use it."
Setting up automatic data analysis pipelines,could be improved for,"We went through each step very slowly, especially for the code alongs"

Setting up automatic data analysis pipelines,worked well for,"I like that we get to code along. Also nice that the feedback survey is not longer called ""morning, part 1"" etc."
Setting up automatic data analysis pipelines,worked well for,I like the time for explanation of the concept. I'm very new to this way of thinking so it helps conceptualize it for me that there is time so I can ask with base in my own situation
Setting up automatic data analysis pipelines,worked well for,"It was good that the target pipelines were explained slowly and that we had the diagrams in the reading files. Again, impresive work of the instructors in helping the orange hats."
