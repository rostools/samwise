2025-12-05,"The last day a lot of questions were shut down with ""this is not a statistics course"" - I felt that was really good. The first two days there were quite a few questions we spent time discussing that kind of went on a tangent. One example was how to round the numbers in the descriptive table. Could have just said ""there are many ways - we will do what the course material says"". Sometimes questions are good and relevant for many people, but sometimes they are just distracting. I feel the instructors in general could be better at distinguishing which questions need to be shut down and which bring fruitful discussions to the course."
2025-12-05,Thank you all for this great course !
2025-12-08,For each section it could be good to describe the overall goal and what is aimed to produce in the given section.

I was a bit confused sometimes.I really appreciate everything I learned and am looking forward to using it in my work. Thank you for a very rewarding course/workshop."
